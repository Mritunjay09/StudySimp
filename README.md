# StudySimp (DevFlow Notes)

A small browser-extension popup UI for taking developer notes and lightweight study/flow features. Built with React and Vite and packaged as a Manifest V3 extension.

**Key tech:** `React` (JSX), `Vite`, `lucide-react` icons, `Tailwind` (dev deps), `PostCSS`.

**Quick links**

- **Popup entry:** `src/popup/index.html`
- **Main component:** `src/popup/Popup.jsx`
- **Build output:** `dist/` (generated by `vite build`)
- **Extension manifest:** `src/popup/public/manifest.json`

**Overview**

- This project implements a popup-based browser extension UI. The popup contains a simple notes UI with a formatting toolbar, search, and placeholders for other tabs (LeetCode, Focus, Status, Settings).
- The popup UI is authored as a small React app located under `src/popup`. Vite is configured to use that folder as the dev/build root.

**Requirements**

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm (or yarn)

**Install**
Run from the repository root:

```
npm install
```

**Development (Live preview)**

- Start the Vite dev server for the popup UI:

```
npm run dev
```

- Open the dev server in a browser at `http://localhost:5173` to preview the popup page as a normal web page. Note: when running as a web page (dev server), the extension environment is not active. Use the build step to create an unpacked extension for the browser.

**Build & Load as an Unpacked Extension**

- Build the production bundle (Vite will output `dist/` at the repo root):

```
npm run build
```

- After `npm run build`, load the extension in Chrome/Edge/Brave:
  1. Open `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/`).

2.  Enable **Developer mode**.
3.  Click **Load unpacked** and select the `dist/` folder created by the build.

Notes:

- The `manifest.json` used for packaging is `src/popup/public/manifest.json`. Vite copies files from the `public` folder into `dist` during the build.

**Project structure (important files)**

- `package.json` — project metadata and scripts (`dev`, `build`, `preview`).
- `vite.config.js` — Vite config; `root: 'src/popup'` and `outDir: 'dist'`.
- `src/popup/index.html` — popup HTML entry.
- `src/popup/main.jsx` — React entry that mounts `Popup`.
- `src/popup/Popup.jsx` — main popup UI, contains navigation and layout.
- `src/popup/public/manifest.json` — extension manifest (Manifest V3).
- `src/styles.css` — shared styles for the popup.

**Current status & TODOs**

- UI: core popup layout implemented with navigation and a notes editor component.
- Features not implemented / placeholders:

  - `LeetCode.jsx` is empty — intended for a LeetCode summarizer.
  - `Status.jsx` is empty — intended for a growth.
  - `settings.jsx` is empty — intended for a theme change, Timer sound, Pomodoro Timer setting, Data Management.
  - No persistence layer — notes are not yet saved to `localStorage` or synced.
  - No keyboard shortcuts or rich formatting logic is wired up (toolbar buttons are UI-only).

Suggested next tasks:

- Add local persistence (e.g., `localStorage` wrapper) for notes.
- Implement the `Focus` timer and integrate session state.
- Wire up formatting toolbar and markdown rendering preview.
- Add automated tests and CI linting/prettier.

**Contributing**

- Feel free to open issues or submit PRs. Keep changes focused and add tests for new logic where appropriate.
